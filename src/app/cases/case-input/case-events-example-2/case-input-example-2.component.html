<h2>Service communication and @Input</h2>

<p>
  All messages from senders are emitted to parent Node via service, which then
  passes it via @Input to child node. Some receivers have their messages
  initialized with <code>setTimeout()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Service communication via observables don't trigger change detector. Only the
  part where Node is passing message by changing @Input reference does.
</p>

<p>Reload example couple of times and try different scenarios.</p>

<ol class="badge-list">
  <li>
    Emits message via service to Node-2-2, which passes it via @Input to
    Node-2-2-1
  </li>
  <li>
    Emits message via service to Node-2-1, which passes it via @Input to
    Node-2-1-1
  </li>
</ol>
